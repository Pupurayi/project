   <p >
      Im  Pupurayi Paula Marisa, a second year Software Engineering undergraduate at <a class="anchors" href="https://hit.ac.zw">Harare Institute of Technology</a>. My interest is in web design
     and data science. There is something fascinating about seeing people access something you made and appreciating it.
     As of now i do not have a lot of experience in web design but im going to get there, as they say a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
