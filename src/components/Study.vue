  </p>

  <p>  After my A Level,I applied at HIT and i still remember, Software Engineering
    was my last prefference. I was actually scared  &#128550; when i got the place,i had no history with computers. Luckily here i am...I can actually see that this was the best
   decision i ever made. It reminds me of how God knows what is best for us. I fell in love with SE &#128525; the first lecture when we were told how much we can do and how people like us are vital in todays living. The fact tha we will be solving problems
   in a technical way was the most fascinating. I imagined myself putting a smile on ones face after having made a system for him.
   one of the most motivating factors came from my lecturer - my favourite if i can say. I actually saw myself through him. He wanted to do Pharmacy as well but he was offered a place to study Computer Science instead.
   Fastforward, he has made a lot of functioning systems some for the country. It gives the vibe that I too can make it. The vibe that nothing is impossible.
