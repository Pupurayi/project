   My inspiration comes from those who have made it and im confident that one day I will testify. These are the quotes that keep me going, whenever i feel i cant make it
   i always get back to them.<br>
   
   <q>There is nothing impossible to him who try.</q><i>Alexander the Great</i>
    <q>The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.</q><i>Lao Tzu</i><br>
     <q>If my mind can conceive it,and my heart can believe it - then i can achieve it.</q><i>Muhammed Ali</i><br>
    His grace is always sufficient!
